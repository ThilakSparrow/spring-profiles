# spring-profiles

Spring Profiles is the feature that allows us to organize and maintain the application configurations and switch seamlessly between different environments. we can able to create and manage multiple application.properties or application.yml files for different runtime environments, such as Dev,Prod,SIT,QA etc. 

### Why Spring Profiles?

> To Maintain the configuration files for multiple environments.
> To Externalize the application
> To Make the application environment specific.

Without Spring Profiles, We will write different microservices or JAR file with application configuration in application properties files for different environments. so , it was a not best way and it is not efficient way .
